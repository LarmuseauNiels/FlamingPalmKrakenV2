It's very important to keep your identity hidden until the reveal party,
so we've made it possible to message your recipient and secret santa anonymously using the bot.
Use the command /send-to-receiver in this chat to message your gift recipient,
and use the command /send-to-santa to reply to your secret santa. 
It's that simple!
**Please read and reply to messages in this chat ASAP**

You'll also receive organisational messages with important information from time to time, so keep a look out for those. 
Some messages will have a button to confirm you have completed the action. 
Please use this button when applicable so we can confirm everyone has received / sent their gift!

Have a Merry Christmas!ðŸŽ„ `,
